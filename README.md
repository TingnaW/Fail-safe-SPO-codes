# Fail-safe SPO
Here are the **data and codes** to reproduce the results in the paper ***On improved fail-safe sensor distributions for a structural health monitoring system***.

A series of tests were performed on a **glider wing** in an environmental chamber to provide a data set suitable for this research. 
The deployment of 36 candidate sensors is shown in Figure **SensorDeployment**.
The first four mode shapes and corresponding natural frequencies are shown in Figure **ModeShapes15_1_4**.
